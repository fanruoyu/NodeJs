```C
napi_status napi_resolve_deferred(napi_env env,
                                  napi_deferred deferred,
                                  napi_value resolution);
```

- `[in] env`: The environment that the API is invoked under.
- `[in] deferred`: The deferred object whose associated promise to resolve.
- `[in] resolution`: The value with which to resolve the promise.

This API resolves a JavaScript promise by way of the deferred object
with which it is associated. Thus, it can only be used to resolve JavaScript
promises for which the corresponding deferred object is available. This
effectively means that the promise must have been created using
`napi_create_promise()` and the deferred object returned from that call must
have been retained in order to be passed to this API.

The deferred object is freed upon successful completion.
