* `callbacks` {Object} The [Hook Callbacks][] to register
  * `init` {Function} The [`init` callback][].
  * `before` {Function} The [`before` callback][].
  * `after` {Function} The [`after` callback][].

* Returns: `{AsyncHook}` Instance used for disabling and enabling hooks

Registers functions to be called for different lifetime events of each async
operation.

The callbacks `init()`/`before()`/`after()`/`destroy()` are called for the
respective asynchronous event during a resource's lifetime.

All callbacks are optional. For example, if only resource cleanup needs to
be tracked, then only the `destroy` callback needs to be passed. The
specifics of all functions that can be passed to `callbacks` is in the
[Hook Callbacks][] section.

```js
const async_hooks = require('async_hooks');

const asyncHook = async_hooks.createHook({
  init(asyncId, type, triggerAsyncId, resource) { },
  destroy(asyncId) { }
});
```

Note that the callbacks will be inherited via the prototype chain:

```js
class MyAsyncCallbacks {
  init(asyncId, type, triggerAsyncId, resource) { }
  destroy(asyncId) {}
}

class MyAddedCallbacks extends MyAsyncCallbacks {
  before(asyncId) { }
  after(asyncId) { }
}

const asyncHook = async_hooks.createHook(new MyAddedCallbacks());
```
